  <h1>The First! - Living in the Moment</h1>

    <p>I had been wanting to do something like this for a while now... where instead of long-form blogging it's much more condensed and sort of just a thought dump. Be warned, they are probably going to be very opinionated.. oops.</p>
<p>So.. welcome to my tidbits! The first topic I want to ramble about is the ability to live in the moment. I'd like to get into deeper philosophical ideas at some point, but I'll keep it surface level for now.</p>
<p>Last week, I was in a conversation with one of my co-workers about a concert they recently attended, and how much fun they had. Nothing to be ashamed of in any regard, I love concerts! But as the conversation evolved, they began to show me pictures and videos of the concert, them having a good time, etc etc.</p>
<p>I am a victim of this in years past, but it's been a while since I've attended an event &quot;worth recording&quot;, so my view on this has changed. I must be out of the know, but I feel as if I were to spend an ample amount of money on something like a concert ticket where my experience would ultimately last a few hours, I would try to do my best to stay off of my phone and soak up the moment? I'm in no way discouraging others from doing so, I would just argue that my money spent would be more worthwhile if I was able to appreciate every bit of the moment while I was in it, rather than to spend it looking through my screen so that I could enjoy it in a future moment.</p>
<p>And yes, I understand that by recording something you essentially extend the life of that memory, but I feel as if some things should be exclusively and mutually enjoyed by you and the universe. It's the same concept with something as simple as seeing a nice sunset and immediately snapping a quick picture. Who hasn't done that? But I think for the times where you could be doing something as 'mundane' as enjoying a bike ride or laying in the grass watching the stars, doing any notable thing that could warrant a recording... just <em>don't</em>.</p>
<p>What happened to just enjoying things? Sure, you'll forget about that moment as the years go by, but I'd argue that the moment will hold more value in that time if you actually live in it.</p>
