  My work! Although I cannot show you everything because we <i>did</i> use this stuff to our advantage day in and day out,
  I'll provide a link to the demo of a dashboard our pitchers use: [REDACTED]. I'll just start by explaining that here.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Some unfamilar terminology to start:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>FPS%</b>: First Pitch Strike % - how many of at-bats start with strike 1?</li>
    <li><b>4PV</b>: 4 Pitch Verdict % - how many at-bats are 4-pitches or less?</li>
    <li><b>CScore</b>: Contact Score - cumulative score of contact gradings</li>
    <li><b>PR</b>: Pitching Runs - cumulative score of successful vs nonsuccessful innings</li>
    <li><b>GScore</b>: Game Score <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/game-score">(Bill James)</a></li>
    <li><b>PPI</b>: Pitches Per Inning</li>
    <li><b>PBF</b>: Pitches Per Batter Faced</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>FLAIR</b>: Weak contact in the air</li>
    <li><b>HOG</b>: Hard-{contact}-On-Ground</li>
    <li><b>LD</b>: Line Drive</li>
    <li><b>POP</b>: Pop-up</li>
    <li><b>PWR</b>: Power shot (in the gap)</li>
    <li><b>WEAK</b>: Weak ground ball</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>The rest of the available information should be easy enough to understand for any (experienced) baseball fan. Now for the guts.</p>

  <br>
  <p>
  All data is stored on a private google sheet, accessible to all of our players via a shared google account based for development, with access to hundreds
  if not thousands of resources for improvement, from mechanics to strength and conditioning to recovery. But that's all extra. For the dashboard, I wanted
  a visually-appealing and easy-to-understand page that would hold all available information needed for a pitcher to look at their stats and go "oh, I'm doing X
  well, but Y bad", or "oh, I need to improve Z". This dashboard allows for all of that. In a standard green-good, red-bad approach, any specific pitcher is able
  to tell whether or not the underlying numbers support them or need improved. Additionally, a yellow means they are the best on the team at any specific statistic.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
  All data is manually collected via charting during games, then manually uploaded to this google sheet. Although it can get quite tedious, I honestly don't mind the work.
  Stuff such as the dashboard makes up for it, as I can provide insights to my teammates that might not be the most tech-savvy. The dashboard was a huge step in progress, as
  before all we had was a google sheet with rows and rows of data, which any person could've easily gotten lost in if they weren't looking for the right information.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
  Currently, I'm working on some sort of manual pitch tracking system, similar to what you would get from a trackman (without spin metrics): pitch location, count, result, and more.
  Being able to use something like this would also drastically help our staff out, helping with a broad range of topics like command and/or strengths and weakneses of pitch types.
