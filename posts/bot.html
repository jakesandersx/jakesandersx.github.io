  Monkey Bot. I don't quite remember why I named it 'Monkey', but I was in high school so I guess that can be my 'embarrassing story'. Originally, monkey
  bot started off as a proof-of-concept, and a challenge for myself to code something bigger than just a calculator. I was a huge nerd at the time, so I built
  the bot based around my clash royale clan - stuff like retrieving player rankings, showing various statistics, basic API stuff provided by Supercell. As time
  went on, I increased my level of coding and the bot became a little symbol of such. Over the years, I would continuously look back at the code I had written,
  re-optimize it, write some new functions and features, and leave it alone for a couple months until the cycle repeated.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Once I started getting into some more advanced programming courses at university, the bot saw some serious upgrades. I began tracking discord logs (with consent
  from the community), integrating some maching learning tactics, and providing actual useful information to the higher-ups of the clan.

  A big issue within our clan <i>used to be</i> clan war attacks. These "war day attacks" would big the deciding factor on whether or not your clan
  "won" the current war, and these wars reaped huge rewards. Therefore, it was very rewarding to win these wars, which often required the help of all
  50 members. There, a problem arises, and can be solved. Using a custom but simple <b>link</b> command, a user would be able to link their clash royale
  account to their discord account within the bot, which was stored on a simple .txt file on the server. Then, using a custom written <b>ping</b> command, the bot
  would scan over all linked accounts, and if they were currently in the clan, would mention them in the discord if they had not completed their attacks for
  the day, which would send a real-time push notification to their phone.
  </p>

  Another feature I worked on for a long time was our <b>promotion</b> feature. Due to the long-term nature of our clan standing (over 7 years!), it
  can get difficult on tracking who is deserving of (and who is not) promotion within the clan. A new model was implemented to track all players within
  the clan and determine an arbitrary "score" of how well they had performed within the clan. Factors such as whether or not they had improved, consistency,
  card levels, and others would all be taken into consideration. This model is purely mathematical, which does not take into account factors such as behavior
  and personality, which can both drastically help or minimize one's chances of promotion within our community.
